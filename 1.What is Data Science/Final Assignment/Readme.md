# Final Assignment about Data Science and Reports

##### **Question 1:** Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science? **(3 marks)**

**Data Science:**
Data science is what data scientists are doing. It includes all the necessary procedures and operations performed on the data from its formation, collection and structurisation to the results, graphs and forecasts derived from it. Naturally, in the middle of this sequence are data analysis and processing, which include a plethora of methods and techniques. Basically, it is a structured approach to analysing data and revealing meaning and trends behind it, if in short.

**Data scientists:**
A data scientist is a curious person that analyses some amount of data to answer questions or solve problems that are important to them. Ideally, they are supposed to do it with appropriate tools: math, statistics, programming, etc. But sometimes, data scientists can be just those curious people who use at least some structured ways, analytical approaches and their minds to analyse significant amounts of data. Now the second part of being a data scientist is also the ability to present the results of one's findings and tell a compelling story about those results.

These terms do not have a single distinct definition as they usually involve other sciences and techniques: engineering, statistics, mathematics, biology, etc.

##### **Question 2:** As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. What industry are you passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in? **(1 mark)**

I am passionate about digitalisationâ€”any digitalisation: from smart homes to smart factories. I do look into things like IoT, Industry 4.0, AI, AR, VR, various intelligent assistants, etc.
Therefore, I would like to work in that field, but in technical aspects. Not like sales, but maybe study some features usage or engineering applications of said devices/technologies. Or possibly app development in the area. I do not have a distinct idea yet as I lack skills of a data scientist; however, I am sure I will find something as soon as I get the needed qualifications.
For now, I would say IT, Industry 4.0 or software development.
