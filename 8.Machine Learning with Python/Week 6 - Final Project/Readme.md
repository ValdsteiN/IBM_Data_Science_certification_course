# Final Project

## Learning Objectives
- The Machine Learning knowledge on a problem.
- Submit a link to your project notebook and a complete project report.

## Review Criteria

Now that you have been equipped with the skills to use different Machine Learning algorithms, over the course of five weeks, you will have the opportunity to practice and apply it on a dataset. In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

    - k-Nearest Neighbour
    - Decision Tree
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

    - Jaccard index
    - F1-score
    - LogLoass

This final project will be graded by your peers who are completing this course during the same session. This project is worth **25** marks of your total grade, broken down as follows:

1. Building model using KNN, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**7 marks**)
2. Building model using Decision Tree, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**6 marks**)
3. Building model using SVM, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**6 marks**)
4. Building model using Logistic Regression, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation (**6 marks**)
