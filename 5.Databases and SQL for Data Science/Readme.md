## About the course

Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a powerful language which is used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. A working knowledge of databases and SQL is a must if you want to become a data scientist.

The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help you learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.  

The emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning . As such, you will work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. You will create a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs you will practice building and running SQL queries. You will also learn how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.
 
## What you will learn

- Create and access a database instance on cloud

- Write basic SQL statements: CREATE, DROP, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

- Filter, sort, group results, use built-in functions, access multiple tables

- Access databases from Jupyter using Python and work with real world datasets
